	\section{Overview}
	\underline{Software Engineering} - The application of sound engineering practices to software creation and maintenance.
		\subsection{Software development Life Cycle (Traditional Approach)}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Requirements Phase
				\item Analysis or Specification Phase
				\item Design Phase
				\item Implementation/Integration Phase
				\item Maintenance Phase
				\item Retirement
			\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Requirements Phase}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Determining the \textsc{needs} and \textsc{wants} of the client or customer.
				\item Determining the constraints of the system.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Analysis or Specification Phase}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item After analyzing the requirements, construct a \emph{specification document} which explicitly describes what the product is to do, and the constraints under which it must operate.
				\item This includes the description of the input, output, actions, and UI.
				\item The specification document can be used as part of a contract with the client.
			\end{itemize}
			\paragraph{Problems with the Spec Document}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Ambiguity - one sentence may have more than one interpretation.
				\item Incompleteness - relevant fact or requirement is left out.
				\item Contradiction - two places in the spec document are in conflict.
			\end{enumerate}
		\subsubsection{Design Phase}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Construct an \emph{Architectural Design}.
				\item Construct a \emph{Detailed Design}.
				\item Test for \emph{traceability}.
			\end{itemize}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \underline{Architectural Design} - Description of the product in terms of modules.
				\item \underline{Detailed Design} - Description of each module.
				\item \underline{Traceability} - each part of the design can be traced to a statement in the specification document.
			\end{enumerate}
		\subsubsection{Implementation Phase}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Code each module from the detailed design.
				\item Programmer tests his/her own code separately.
				\item Modules are combined and tested by developers.
				\item Product is tested by SQA group. This is called product testing.
				\item Project is given to the client for acceptance testing.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Maintenance Phase}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Corrective Maintenance - bug squashing
				\item Enhancement Maintenance - Updates
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Perfective - client makes new demands
					\item Adaptive - changes in the environment of the product requires changes in the software.
				\end{itemize}
				\item Perform regression testing - insuring that changes have not affected already working functionality.
			\end{itemize}
		\subsubsection{Retirement Phase}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Determining if desired changes are too costly.
				\item Determining if a product is obsolete.
			\end{itemize}
	\paragraph{Four Components of the Software Engineering Enterprise}\\
	The four P's
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Process
		\item Project
		\item People
		\item Product
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Process}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The process is sometimes called the lifecycle model or development sequence.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Waterfall
				\item Spiral
				\item Incremental Build
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
